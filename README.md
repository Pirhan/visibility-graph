A visualization of the following well-known shortest path finding algorithms in a visibility graph.
- A* Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm


There are 3 steps you need to take to start visualizing:
- Initialize the project structure to include the following libs (necessary libs are provided under the **libs** folder)
  - **_jgrapht-core_**
  - **_slick_** (don't forget to provide **lwjgl.dll** / **lwjgl64.dll** as the **Native Library Locations** if you are working on Windows.)
  - **_lwjgl_** (mentioned above)
- Run the demo
