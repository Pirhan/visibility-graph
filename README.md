# visibility-graph
A visualization of the following well-known shortest path finding algorithms in a visibility graph.
- A* Algorithm (yellow colored representation)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (white colored representation)


There are 3 steps you need to take to start the simulation:
- Initialize the project structure to include the following libs (they are provided under **libs** folder)
  - **_jgrapht-core_**
  - **_slick_** (unzip the zip file, add both lwjgl.jar and slick.jar from the **libs** folder into **Libraries** inside your **Project Structure**, and also don't forget to provide **lwjgl.dll** as the **Native Library Locations** if you are working on Windows.)
  - **_lwjgl_** (mentioned above)
- Run the demo
